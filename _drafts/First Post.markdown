Well that's it. After around 5 months of slaving over a hot design board, my group has managed to create a drone *Cue Trumpet Fan-fair here*. This is not just any drone. Oh no, this is a super sexy canard quad-tilt rotor.

###WOW

#### ***But what is this?***
For all you non aero people out there, myself included, this is simply an aircraft which can fly up vertically, have the rotors tilt forward and then continue on in forward flight. Obviously this is reversed for landing. The canard design is to simple have two wings, a small one at the front and a large one at the back at different heights.

def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
