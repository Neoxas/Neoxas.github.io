_Place of writing : The train home with a minor headache (go getting hit in the face!)_

# By god that was a journey to get here!

 Who would of thought it would of been so hard (and taken so long!) to get to Sheffield from Bath. After finally deciding to haemorrhage money and buy a train ticket (Â£61 with a rail card to get to Sheffield! My team mate managed to get flights to Norway for cheaper than that!) we embarked on a journey filled with walking, awkwardly trying to sit on train seats and screaming babies. 

### Just. The. Screaming. Babies.

I mean I thought my Kiai's were loud but this baby put everyone to shame! At least her mother knows she has a healthy set of lungs for the future.

Eventually, we made it off the train (and away from the screaming babies) to arrive in Sheffield intact and ready for the competition. However, there was one thing stopping us for performing at our best.

# HUNGER

So what was there about in Sheffield? Only an awesome place called Sumo San.

Seriously, if your ever in Sheffield, check this place out! The food there was awesome and reasonably priced for sushi.

### I mean seriously look at this stuff!!

(Insert photo of sushi here)

Anyway with our bellies all full and our eyes full of hope we headed to our hotel to get a good nights rest before the competition.

# THE COMPETITION DAY

I think this was around the 6th time I've been to this venue for a competition, but I can never get over the amount of heat in that room. Seriously, when you walk through those doors it's like being transported to the Amazon Rainforest!

Anyway, once we fought our way through heat exhaustion and the arduous stairs, my fellow karate-ka and I were ready to head out onto those mats and make a name for our selves (and hopefully bring some shiny medals home!)


Sadly the day did not go as planned.

First up was Roger, our resident shito-ryu kata guru who was competing in senior male kata. Roger started out with a strong Kururunafa but sadly lost to the silver medallist who performed a beautiful Arnan. Luckily, the guy got all the way to the final so Roger was able to represent us once again to try and get a bronze medal through repechage. Once again he set out, this time with a solid Nipaipo, but was sadly bested by a clean, but not fast, Sochin.

### So it was over to me and karat-bae to save the day and bring home some kumite medals!

Karat-bae (a.k.a Charlie) set out with a blistering start with a 9-0 victory over her first opponent due to three fabulous (and dare I say it, downright sexy) jodan mawashi's.

Sadly, lightning would not strike twice and she ended up losing her second round 10 - 0. But hope was not lost, as yet again bath karate-ka lost to people who ended in the final, so karate-bae stepped up for the repechage.

After a closely knit and heated fight, another hope was dashed with a 2 - 1 loss.

### So, it was down to me in senior fat-bastard (heavyweight) kumite...

Oooooh boy was this going to be an uphill struggle with my first fighter being an experienced Welsh squad member (I mean seriously, this guy had been fighting for 31 years!).

Thanks to some amazing help from both my coach, Ali Nyoni and a friend at a fellow dojo, I had a game plan formed and I was ready to take this monster down!

## AND THEN IT WENT OUT THE WINDOW

My plan was to hide any form of kicking until the perfect opportunity was present, and there goes me throwing it out there in the first 20 seconds! (Dammit Alex why don't you ever listen to your past self amazing plans!) To put the icing on the cake, this mawashi went so badly I ended up spinning round, losing track of the guy and getting kicked in the face.

#### _GREAT_

20 seconds into the fight and I'm 3 points down and my game plan has gone out the window! This was where the tension kicked in and I started looking like I was moving through treacle. From this point on I couldn't seem to recover anything or get near to the guy, so I sadly ended my fight on 4 - 0. Even worse, he lost to another fighter in the next round, so I was out of the repechage.

## So there we have it

The hopes of three karate-ka dashed at a tough competition. However, we all left with our heads held high (well aside from me who was dissecting my fight and trying to work out why I fought so badly) with more experience under our belts and things to improve next time.

## Here's to onwards and upwards!!
