# By god that was a journey to get here!

 Who would of thought it would of been so hard (and taken so long!) to get to Sheffield from Bath. After finally deciding to hemmorage money and by a train ticket (Â£61 with a rail card to get to Sheffield!! My team mate managed to get flights to Norway for cheaper than that!) we embarked on a journey filled with walking, awkwardly trying to sit on train seats and screaming babies. 

### Just. The. screaming. babies.

I mean I thought my Kia's were loud but this baby put everyone to shame! At least he mother knows she has a healthy set of lungs for the future.

Luckily we had booked a hotel and so had a nice peaceful quite night sleep before fighting in the morning.
