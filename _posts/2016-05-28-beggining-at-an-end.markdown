Well that's it. After around 3 months of slaving over a hot design board, my group has managed to create a drone _'Cue Trumpet Fan-fair here'_. 

This is not just any drone. Oh no, this is a super sexy canard quad-tilt rotor.

### WOW

#### ***But what is this?***
For all you non aero people out there, myself included, there are two key aspects about this which make it unique, being the tilt-rotor mechanism and the canard design. 

The tilt-rotor is the ability for the motors on the aircraft to be able to rotate between a vertical and horizontal level, allowing for the aircraft to be able to take off vertically and transition into standard horizontal flight. This gives the drone the ability to do VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) which brings the obvious advantage of being able to fly within a minute landing zone.

The canard design is to simply have two wings, a small one at the front and a large one at the back at different heights on the body, which often leads to an increase in the maneuverability of the aircraft.

Well after 3 gruelling months and a lot of sleep lost between 8 student we produced this, The ARC Phoenix:

#### ***PHEW!***

A lot of though, sweat and, at some time I'm sure, blood went into producing this model. This couldn't of been possible without the contribution of each and every team member I worked with, who all performed exceptionally!

Hopefully, in the coming year, we will get to build this beast and see it fly. The current expectation is it will either be a glorious bringer of salvation to troubled environments, or it will come crashing down in flames. Either way, it will live up to its name!
