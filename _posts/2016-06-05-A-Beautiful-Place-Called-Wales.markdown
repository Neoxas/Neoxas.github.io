# Well that's it

My fourth year at the University of Bath is officially over and I've been made to move out of my house.

As any uni student knows, this involves trekking all the random garbage you have seem to of collected over the year back to your home, which for me just happens to be in Wales. (Although, luckily for me, I always seem to have somewhere in Bath to store half of it)

So on a lovely, gloomy Friday morning, I got out of bed super early to pack and organise all the junk in my room and begin the fun of shunting it to wherever I was going t store it.

This day turned out to be one of the nicest days I've seen recently (and just bear in mind, every time I've been back to Wales recently it has been raining)

## WOW

### _Did I forget how pretty Wales was_

Seriously, I swear Wales must be one of the prettiest places in the UK (Sadly I still haven't been to Scotland or Ireland) or even the world. On the way back there was an image which simply took my breath away. As we were coming around a hill there was a sweeping view across the lake, the red sun setting and casting its light across the glistening water with the luscious green rolling hills in a distance.

## GENUINELY

### That could of been a photo in an art gallery.

So for any of you that haven't visited Wales give it a try, just like im going to go to Scotland and Ireland.

I'd recommend somewhere around the Brecon Beacons though, the climb up Pen-y-Fan on a good day will be something that stays with you

Well I'm off to go enjoy this sun riding with Karate in the garden and some horse riding (got to keep that kiba-datchi in practice!)
